### Introduction
This python package implements Spatial Pyramid Matching [1] to recognize images under different categories. Furthermore, Earth Mover's distance [2] is also incorporated to better align parts of images when calculating image-to-image distance. 

For better explanation, please refer to [my report](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37572555/Github/Image%20Recognition/ImageRec.pdf).


### Dependencies
1. python 2.7.x
2. sklearn
3. vlfeat (extract SIFT features)
4. numpy
5. scipy

In terms of vlfeat, do the following steps to ensure SIFT extractions succeed.

1. Download vlfeat and remember the path of vlfeat of your environment
2. Update the following path at line 84 in `/recognition/utils.py` with your own path of vlfeat

```python
os.environ['PATH'] += os.pathsep +'/Users/GongLi/Dropbox/FYP/PythonProject/vlfeat/bin/maci64'
os.system(cmmd)
```

### Usage 
Below are two examples of two approaches to recognise images.
	
	python SpatialPyramidExample.py
	python EarthMoverDistanceExample.py

### Data Set

The image data set, in which there are six classes (shooting, playing guitar, running, phoning, riding bike and riding horse) as shown in Figure 13, comes from [[3]](https://github.com/lipiji/PG_BOW_DEMO). For each class, there are 60 images with different backgrounds, different persons and different viewpoints.
